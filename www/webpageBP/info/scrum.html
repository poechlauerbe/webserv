			<h1>Scrum</h1>
			<p>Scrum is a framework for agile project management that is used to develop software and other products. It is an iterative and incremental approach to project management that helps teams deliver value to their customers faster and more efficiently.</p>
			<p>Scrum is based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation. It is designed to help teams work together more effectively and deliver high-quality products that meet the needs of their customers.</p>
			<p>Scrum is based on a set of roles, events, and artifacts that help teams organize their work and collaborate effectively. Some of the key concepts in Scrum include:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Scrum Master: The Scrum Master is responsible for ensuring that the Scrum framework is followed and that the team is working effectively. They help the team remove any obstacles that are preventing them from delivering value to their customers.</li>
				<li>Product Owner: The Product Owner is responsible for defining the product vision and prioritizing the work that needs to be done. They work closely with the team to ensure that the product meets the needs of the customers.</li>
				<li>Development Team: The Development Team is responsible for delivering the product. They are self-organizing and cross-functional, meaning that they have all the skills and expertise needed to deliver the product.</li>
				<li>Sprint: A Sprint is a time-boxed iteration of work that typically lasts between 1-4 weeks. During a Sprint, the team works to deliver a potentially shippable product increment.</li>
				<li>Product Backlog: The Product Backlog is a prioritized list of all the work that needs to be done on the project. It is managed by the Product Owner and is constantly updated to reflect changes in the project.</li>
				<li>Increment: The Increment is the sum of all the work that the team has completed during a Sprint. It is a potentially shippable product that meets the Definition of Done.</li>
			</ul>
			<p>Scrum is a powerful framework that can help teams deliver value to their customers faster and more efficiently. It is based on the principles of transparency, inspection, and adaptation, and is designed to help teams work together more effectively and deliver high-quality products that meet the needs of their customers.</p>
			<h2 id="experience">My experience with Scrum</h2>
			<p>I attended a theoretical scrum course organized by 42 [&] RBI to get a basic knowledge in Scrum</p>
			<p>I also attended a simulated project where we used Scrum to manage our work. We had (daily) stand-up meetings to discuss our progress, sprint planning meetings to plan our work for the next sprint, sprint review meetings to review our work and get feedback from our stakeholders, and sprint retroperspective to improve ourselves.</p>
