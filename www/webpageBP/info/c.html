			<h1>C experience</h1>
			<p>One of my first programming language was C. I learned it at 42Vienna. Here are some of the projects I did there:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Libft</li>
				<li>get_next_line</li>
				<li>ft_printf</li>
				<li>so_long</li>
				<li>push_swap</li>
				<li>minitalk</li>
				<li>minishell</li>
				<li>philosophers - my favorite project</li>
				<li>cub3D</li>
				<li>ft_shmup</li>
				<li>connect4</li>
				<li>Retro_MFA</li>
			</ul>
			<p>These are some of the projects I did in C. I learned a lot about memory management, pointers, and how to write efficient code. I also learned how to use the LLDB debugger and valgrind to debug my code and check for memory leaks. I also learned how to use the Makefile to compile my projects and how to use a graphic library like the MLX library from 42</p>
			<p>Overall, I really enjoyed working with C and I learned a lot from it. I think it's a great language to learn if you want to understand how computers work at a lower level and how to write efficient code.</p>

			<h3>Philosophers</h3>
			<p>Philosophers is a project where you have to solve the dining philosophers problem using threads and mutexes. The dining philosophers problem is a classic synchronization problem in computer science where a number of philosophers sit at a table and eat spaghetti. The philosophers can only eat if they have both forks and they can only pick up one fork at a time. The challenge is to write a program that allows the philosophers to eat without causing a deadlock.</p>
			<p>Philosophers is my favorite project at 42 in C. I really liked digging in to it and thinking about a logic when multiple processes run in paralell and how to make sure that in each case of error all processes are stopped and everything is freed properly </p>
			<h2 id="tools">Tools</h2>
			<p>Here are some of the tools I used while working with C:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>LLDB debugger (error searching)</li>
				<li>Valgrind (checking for memory leaks)</li>
				<li>Helgrind (checking in multiprocess program for data races and lock order problems)</li>
				<li>Makefile (for compiling)</li>
				<li>42 Mlx (a graphic library we had to use for cub3D and so_long)</li>
			</ul>
			<h2 id="concepts">Concepts</h2>
			<p>Here are some of the concepts I learned while working with C:</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Memory management</li>
				<li>Pointers</li>
				<li>Structures</li>
				<li>Linked lists</li>
				<li>Dynamic memory allocation</li>
				<li>File I/O</li>
				<li>Forks [&] Pipes</li>
				<li>Threads</li>
				<li>Mutexes</li>
				<li>Signals</li>
			</ul>
